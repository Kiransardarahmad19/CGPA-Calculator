# Predictive Analysis for Academic Performance using Linear, Ridge and Lasso Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and Decision Tree

This predictive assessment project aims to evaluate learning outcomes through a comprehensive analysis of various machine learning algorithms. 
The review covers critical issues in predictive analytics, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, data validation, and deployment. 
The initial phase consists of careful data preprocessing to ensure data quality and accuracy. 
Subsequently, exploratory data analysis reveals meaningful insights into the relationships among the variables. Comparative analysis is performed on at least 4-5 AI/ML algorithms in the core predictive modeling phase. Successful data validation procedures are used to build predictions and emphasize the strength of the models . 
The final step is to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitates testing new data. Users can enter the context, select the desired prediction model, and see the predicted results, specifically focusing on SGPA and CGPA for the 5th grade.

##Critical Path:
A→B→G→C→D→E→F→I→J

##Data Preprocessing 
Initially, data cleaning is the start of the process. Graphical techniques such as box plots or histograms
were suggested to identify potential redundancies in the statistical scores. Missing values were handled. Duplicate values were removed and EDA was performed. 

##Predictive Models 
1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. ElasticNet Regression
5. Random Forest
6. Gradient Boosting
7. XGBoost
8. LightGBM
9. Decision Tree
10. Hybrid Model

The models were deployed using Streamlit.
